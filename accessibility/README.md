A Crash Course on Accessibility

Overview
This guide provides an introduction to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), a set of recommendations designed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These guidelines help ensure that digital content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

What is WCAG?
WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) is a framework aimed at making web content more accessible. It focuses on improving the experience for people with diverse needs, such as visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. By following WCAG, websites and applications can be more usable and inclusive.

Key Objectives of WCAG
Perceivable: Information and user interface components must be presented in ways that can be perceived by all users, including alternative formats like text for non-text content.
Operable: Interactive elements must be usable with various input methods, including keyboards and assistive technologies.
Understandable: The content and operation of the interface must be easy to understand.
Robust: Content must be compatible with a wide range of technologies, including assistive devices.
Why Accessibility Matters
Making digital content accessible is not just a legal or ethical obligation, it also improves the user experience for everyone. Ensuring that your content is accessible helps:

Users with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments
People in temporary situations, like using a mobile device in bright sunlight
Older users with changing abilities due to aging
Levels of WCAG Compliance
WCAG defines three levels of accessibility compliance:

Level A: The minimum level of accessibility.
Level AA: The mid-range level, often considered the standard for most websites.
Level AAA: The highest and most strict level of accessibility.
